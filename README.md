## Status

**DEPRECATED** - Since the default Ares theme is now dark, this is probably not useful and is no longer being maintained.

## Overview

This is an alternate AresMUSH theme with a dark background.

## Installing

Use `theme/install <github url>` with an admin character in-game.

> **Note:** Doing this will overwrite your current web portal theme. The files will be backed up to the `aresmush/theme_archive` folder if you need to get them back.
